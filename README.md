Mine-Pop is a decoration mod which adds Funk-Pop in Minecraft! We are heavily inspired from Minecraft, Anime, Films & TV Shows and more generally Pop-Culture.

Currently, there is one season available, consisting of ninety-nine figurines from several different collections. More collections will be released in the future, and we are currently working on an update which will allow the player to make their own custom Mine-Pop!

Feel free to [suggest a collection](https://github.com/pixeldreamstudios/MinePop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml) to be added to Mine-Pop in the future, or [report a bug](https://github.com/pixeldreamstudios/MinePop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) if you find one.
